(Recommended) With `pipx <https://pypi.org/project/pipx/>`_::

    pipx install paul-mclendahand

With pip from PyPI::

    pip install paul-mclendahand
    
With pip from GitHub main branch::

    pip install https://github.com/willkg/paul-mclendahand/archive/main.zip

With pip from a clone of the repository with dev dependencies::

    pip install -e '.[dev]'

    
Quick start
===========

Configure pmac
--------------

pmac needs to know the GitHub user and GitHub project.

You can set configuration in the ``setup.cfg`` file::

   [tool:paul-mclendahand]
   github_user=user
   github_project=project
   main_branch=git-main-branch-name

You can override the ``setup.cfg`` variables with environment variables::

   PMAC_GITHUB_USER=user
   PMAC_GITHUB_PROJECT=project
   PMAC_MAIN_BRANCH=git-main-branch-name

**Optional**

You can also use a GitHub personal access token. You set it in the
``PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`` environment variable.

For example::

    PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=abcdef0000000000000000000000000000000000 pmac listprs

.. Note::

   If you find pmac stops working because it's getting rate-limited by GitHub,
   you should use a personal access token.

Using pmac
----------

After you've configured git, then you can use ``pmac`` like this:

1. Create a new branch::

       git checkout <MAIN-BRANCH>
       git checkout -b update-prs

2. List open PRs::

       pmac listprs

3. Combine some pull requests into it::

       pmac add 5100 5101 5102

   Use the same pull requests numbers as on GitHub.

   Internally, ``pmac`` uses ``git am`` to apply commits from pull requests. If
   you hit a ``git am`` conflict, ``pmac`` will tell you. You can edit the file
   in another terminal to manually resolve the conflict. Then do::

       git add FILE
       git commit

   After that, you can continue with ``pmac``.

4. When you're done, push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request.

   ``pmac`` can help with the PR description::

       pmac prmsg


Why does this project exist?
============================

Two main reasons.

First, GitHub doesn't support combining pull requests. There is a forum post
about it here:
https://github.community/t/feature-request-combine-pull-requests/2250

Second, dependabot (also owned by GitHub) doesn't support grouping dependency
updates into a single pull request. If you have 50 dependency updates, it
creates 50 pull requests (sometimes more!). I have a lot of projects and lack
of grouping updates makes monthly maintenance miserable. There's an issue for
this:
